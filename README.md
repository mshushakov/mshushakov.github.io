SPA based on http://www.dnd5eapi.co/
=======

Currently supports next routers:
--------

*	#classes - shows DND classes with their icons (12 symbols)
*	#classes/:id - shows DND class description based on ID

Installation
--------

No need to install anything. It needs only webserver for static files (imports/exports in JS don't work for local files).  
For example: `SimpleHTTPServer`

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```
